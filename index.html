                    <p>Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good headline for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip that?</p>

                    <p>This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any headlines, titles or subject lines.</p>

                    <p>We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!</p>

                        Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some <span class="negrito">very positive</span> results with these headlines as well. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="p2">
                        They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our collection of <span class="negrito">200 headlines</span> with everyone.
